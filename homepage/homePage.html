            <p class="description">Blood types are classifications used to determine the type of blood based
                on the presence or absence of certain proteins on the surface of red blood
                cells. Blood types are vital in blood donation processes, as the donor's
                blood type must match the recipient's blood type to avoid an immune
                reaction. The main blood types are:Blood Type A: The red blood cells in this type contain a protein
                called
                "Antigen A". People with blood type A can donate blood to those with
                blood types A or AB, and they can receive blood from blood types A and O.
                Blood Type B: The red blood cells in this type contain a protein called
                "Antigen B". People with blood type B can donate blood to those with blood
                types B or AB, and they can receive blood from blood types B and O.
                Blood Type AB: The red blood cells in this type contain both "Antigen A" and "Antigen B". This type
                is considered the "universal recipient," meaning that people with blood type AB can receive blood
                from all other blood types (A, B, AB, and O), but they can only donate blood to people with blood
                type AB.
                Blood Type O: The red blood cells in this type do not contain either Antigen
                A or Antigen B. People with blood type O are considered "universal donors,
                " meaning they can donate blood to anyone, regardless of the recipient's
                blood type. However, they can only receive blood from people with blood
                type O.</p>
